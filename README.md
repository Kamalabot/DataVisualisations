# Visualising and Analysing Data around us #

Numbers decieve when they are written down. Numbers speak the truth when they are visualised accurately, and logically.

Passion to understand the world around me is the reason I entered into Programming. Logical thinking, and decision making is an art which is improved
by the Data available to everyone of us. The tools and the ecosystem surrounding the data analysis, visualisation and prediction has helped me a lot. 

Each notebook in the repository takes very basic approaches to the problem everyone faces with Data analysis, or atleast the ones I faced initially.
Whether it is stock market ticker data, or information about the application usage on a learning platform everything can be visualised. Once visualised
the graphs provide unique insights and knowledge that is very difficult to forget. 

## Libraries used in the notebooks are:

BeautifulSoup
Dataset
Pandas
Plotly
Seaborn
Scikit Learn
Requests
Warnings
Tensorflow
Textwrap
matplotlib
wordcloud
glob
os

Self-contained narrative of the data, the wrangling process followed by visualisation is the pattern followed in every notebook. The purpose
and the findings are shown at the beginning. The contents following that, provides way points to specific locations in the notebook. 

Many notebooks, websites and books have been read, referred and even the heuristics has been copied. My contribution is to use these heuristics and
information in creative ways, and make the visualisation talk eloquently and truthfully.
